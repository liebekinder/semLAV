Experimental evaluation of GUN done for our submission to ESWC 2013 on 12th December 2012

Here are the instructions to reproduce our experiments.
(variable GUNPATH should be set to the full path for folder gun2012)

Generating the data with Berlin Benchmark
-----------------------------------------
Download the Berlin Benchmark generator, contained in bsbmtools-v0.2.zip,
avalaible in http://sourceforge.net/projects/bsbmtools/files/bsbmtools/bsbmtools-0.2/
(last visit 25th january 2013).

Decompress it, and in its top directory, execute:
java -cp ".:lib/*" benchmark.generator.Generator -fc -pc 3250

this will generate the dataset: dataset.nt that contains a million triples about 
3250 products.

Compiling the sources
---------------------
In the folder $GUNPATH/code/queryExecutor/src/, execute:
javac -cp ".:$GUNPATH/code/queryExecutor/lib2/*" *.java
javac -cp ".:$GUNPATH/code/queryExecutor/lib2/*" experimentseswc/*.java

Producing the views, ground truth, and conjunctive queries
----------------------------------------------------------
to run the query evaluation engine
----------------------------------
Move dataset.nt to the folder: $GUNPATH/code/expfiles/berlinData/datasets
Execute the script $GUNPATH/code/queryExecutor/src/runGenerateData.sh
The execution of this script could take a long time since the answer to some of 
the queries are quite large, query1 answer has over 7 million triples.
Note: if you got the answers generated in other system, you should sort them
using the script: 
$GUNPATH/code/expfiles/scripts/sortFolder.sh $GUNPATH/code/expfiles/berlinData/answers

Generating the rewritings
-------------------------
go to the folder: $GUNPATH/code, and execute the script: 
$GUNPATH/code/genRewsBerlin.sh
You can change the values of variables SETUPS, QUERIES, TIMEOUT; if you want to
run just a subset of the experiment or change the amount of time given to
generate the rewritings of each query per setup.

We considered different values for TIMEOUT, but the rewritings that couldn't be
generated in 3 minutes neither could be generated in 3 hours.

Evaluation of the three engines using the three different setups proposed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open the script $GUNPATH/code/queryExecutor/src/runBerlin.sh, modify the following
variables to configurate the experiment, the following values will execute
the whole experiment:

STRATS="GUN JENA LLP"
SETUPS="75views 150views 300views"
QUERIES=`seq 1 18`

Nevertheless considering query1 will increase considerably the execution time of
the whole experiment, but you can choose which experiment you want to execute.

Execute the script: $GUNPATH/code/queryExecutor/src/runBerlin.sh

Now, you can find the results at:
$GUNPATH/code/expfiles/berlinOutput/$setup, where $setup corresponds
to the setup you ran from $SETUPS.
